In this implementation, the Singleton pattern is achieved by creating a private static instance of the `Logger` class and a private constructor to prevent external instantiation. A public static method `getInstance()` checks if the instance is null and creates it only once, ensuring that only one object exists throughout the application's lifecycle. To test this, we retrieve two references ('log1' and 'log2' and 'log3') using 'Logger.getInstance()' and compare them. If both references point to the same object, it confirms that only one instance is being used, thus validating the Singleton pattern.
