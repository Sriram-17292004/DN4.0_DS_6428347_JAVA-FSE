Big O notation is a way to describe the efficiency of an algorithm by analyzing how its performance scales with the size of the input. It helps developers choose the most appropriate algorithm by focusing on growth trends rather than specific execution times. For search operations, linear search* has a best-case time of O(1) (when the item is at the beginning), an average-case and worst-case of O(n), as it may need to scan the entire array. In contrast, binary search offers a best of O(1) when element in middle, average, and worst-case time of O(log n), making it significantly faster—but it requires the data to be sorted. For an e-commerce platform with a large product catalog, binary search is generally more suitable* when searching by numeric identifiers like productId , due to its efficiency. However, for fields that aren’t sorted, like product names or categories, either linear search or more advanced indexing methods (e.g., hash maps or full-text search) should be used.
